# Documentation portal

Welcome! This folder collects the human-facing documentation for the Webasto Next Modbus integration. Inspired by the structure of the [Spook](https://github.com/frenck/spook) project, the goal is to keep a single entry point that guides you to the right level of detail.

## Getting started

- **User guide** – The top-level [`README.md`](../README.md) covers installation (HACS and manual), configuration, entity overviews, and troubleshooting tips.
- **Quick install notes** – The [Quick start](../README.md#quick-start) section shows the fastest path from checkout to a running integration.

## Deep dives

- **Architecture** – [`architecture.md`](architecture.md) explains the register map, data flow, and design goals.
- **Development** – [`development.md`](development.md) documents local setup, tooling commands, the virtual wallbox simulator, and the release checklist.

## Support & community

- Review the new [`support.md`](support.md) page for tips on collecting diagnostics, known limitations, and where to ask for help.
- Join the [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/tomwellnitz/Webasto-Next-Modbus/discussions) to share ideas or request enhancements.

## Release history

- Keep an eye on [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md) for user-visible changes per release.
- The [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/tomwellnitz/Webasto-Next-Modbus/releases) links binary assets and highlights upgrade notes.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute or run the integration from source, start with [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md) and the development guide above. The tooling, testing strategy, and release playbook mirror the practices used by leading Home Assistant custom integrations.
