## Quick start

### Requirements

- Home Assistant 2024.6 or newer (tested against the current stable release).
- A Webasto Next or Ampure Unite wallbox reachable over Modbus TCP (default port `502`).
- Network reachability from Home Assistant to the wallbox and the correct Modbus unit ID (factory default `255`).

### Installation via HACS (recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant and browse to **Integrations ‚Üí ‚ãÆ ‚Üí Custom repositories**.
2. Add `https://github.com/tomwellnitz/Webasto-Next-Modbus` as a custom repository of type **Integration**.
3. Install **Webasto Next Modbus** and restart Home Assistant when prompted.

### Manual installation

1. Create `custom_components/webasto_next_modbus` inside your Home Assistant configuration directory.
2. Copy the contents of `custom_components/webasto_next_modbus/` from this repository into that directory.
3. Restart Home Assistant to load the integration.

### Optional: local Home Assistant stack with Docker Compose

A minimal Docker Compose file in `docker/docker-compose.yml` starts Home Assistant with this repository mounted live:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

The compose stack binds `ha-config/` as `/config` and mounts `custom_components/` and `blueprints/` directly from your checkout, so code edits are instantly available. Restart the container to reload Python modules:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml restart homeassistant
```

Prerequisites:

- Docker Desktop (macOS/Windows) or a compatible Docker Engine.
- Port `8123` on the host must be free.

Access the UI at <http://localhost:8123>. Duplicate the compose file with a different `ha-config` mount when you need multiple sandboxes.

### Post-installation checklist

- Add the integration through **Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services ‚Üí Add Integration** and search for ‚ÄúWebasto Next Modbus‚Äù.
- Confirm that the onboarding wizard validates the Modbus connection and stores the expected host/port/unit ID combination.
- Verify that the new device exposes sensors, numbers, and buttons after the first coordinator refresh.

## Configuration & usage

During the onboarding wizard you will be asked for:

- **Host** ‚Äì IP address or DNS hostname of the wallbox.
- **Port** ‚Äì Modbus TCP port (default `502`).
- **Unit ID** ‚Äì Modbus unit ID/slave ID (default `255`).
- **Scan interval** ‚Äì Polling interval in seconds (`2‚Äì60`, default `5`).
- **Variant** ‚Äì Hardware tier (11‚ÄØkW/16‚ÄØA or 22‚ÄØkW/32‚ÄØA). Write actions are automatically clamped to the selected limit.

The config flow validates credentials by reading a known register set and stores a deterministic unique ID (`<host>-<unit_id>`) to avoid duplicate entries.

### Entity overview

| Category | Highlights |
| --- | --- |
| Sensors | Charging state, IEC 61851 status, per-phase current/voltage, instantaneous power, session energy, EV limits, timestamps, serial number, charge point ID, firmware, rated power, phase configuration. |
| Numbers | Dynamic charging current, fail-safe current, fail-safe timeout. |
| Buttons | `Send Keepalive`, `Start Charging`, `Stop Charging` for quick manual overrides. |

All entities are delivered through a shared `DataUpdateCoordinator` to guarantee consistent snapshots for dashboards and automations.

### Service helpers

The following services are available under the `webasto_next_modbus` domain. When multiple wallboxes are configured provide `config_entry_id` to target a specific device.

| Service | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `webasto_next_modbus.set_current` | Set the dynamic charging current (`0‚Äì32‚ÄØA`, clamped to the configured variant). |
| `webasto_next_modbus.set_failsafe` | Configure fail-safe current and optional timeout (`6‚Äì120‚ÄØs`). |
| `webasto_next_modbus.send_keepalive` | Trigger the keep-alive frame to maintain connectivity without changing the charging state. |
| `webasto_next_modbus.start_session` | Start a charging session (mirrors the on-wallbox FastCharge helper). |
| `webasto_next_modbus.stop_session` | Stop the active charging session (mirrors the FullCharge helper). |

Each service writes to the appropriate Modbus register and forces an immediate refresh so dashboards reflect state changes right away.

## Monitoring & automations

### Device triggers

| Trigger ID | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `charging_started` | Wallbox transitioned from idle to charging. |
| `charging_stopped` | Charging session ended, wallbox returned to idle. |
| `connection_lost` | Coordinator detected a communication failure. |
| `connection_restored` | Connection recovered after a failure. |
| `keepalive_sent` | Manual keep-alive frame was dispatched. |

Create automations via **Settings ‚Üí Automations & Scenes ‚Üí Add Automation ‚Üí Device Trigger** and select your wallbox device.

### Blueprint

`blueprints/automation/webasto_next_modbus/fastcharge_fullcharge.yaml` links two helpers (for example ‚ÄúFastCharge‚Äù and ‚ÄúFullCharge‚Äù) to the `start_session` and `stop_session` services. Import the blueprint through Home Assistant‚Äôs Blueprint UI, select the config entry ID of your wallbox, and pick two toggles to act as virtual buttons.

### Virtual wallbox simulator

Install the project with the `dev` extra and run the CLI to expose a Modbus TCP simulator:

```bash
virtual-wallbox --host 0.0.0.0 --port 15020
```

Point a development Home Assistant instance to the simulator for regression testing or feature development. Scenario files and advanced options are documented in `docs/development.md`.

## Troubleshooting & diagnostics

- **Connection failures** ‚Äì Check reachability with `ping`, verify TCP port `502` is open, and make sure the unit ID matches the wallbox configuration.
- **Stale data** ‚Äì The coordinator retries transient errors three times and raises a persistent notification if connectivity remains down. Review the Home Assistant log for detailed stack traces.
- **Diagnostics export** ‚Äì Download diagnostics via **Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services ‚Üí Webasto Next Modbus ‚Üí ‚ãÆ ‚Üí Download diagnostics** to inspect register snapshots and error history.
- **Debug logging** ‚Äì Add the following to `configuration.yaml` to surface detailed Modbus traces:

  ```yaml
  logger:
    default: info
    logs:
      custom_components.webasto_next_modbus: debug
  ```

## Localization

English is the default language. A German translation ships in `translations/de.json`; other locales fall back to English.

## Development & testing

- Create a virtual environment, install the project with `pip install -e '.[dev]'`, and run `pytest` to execute the full test suite.
- Use `python -m ruff check` for static analysis and formatting guardrails.
- The virtual wallbox simulator (see above) mirrors the register map and powers both automated and manual tests.
- `docker/docker-compose.yml` provides an opt-in Home Assistant sandbox that mounts the integration live for UI-level testing.
- Development documentation lives in `docs/development.md`.

## Operations & release playbook

- Track notable changes in `CHANGELOG.md` and keep the integration version in `custom_components/webasto_next_modbus/manifest.json` aligned with releases.
- Run `pytest` and `ruff` before tagging a release to ensure parity with CI.
- Tag releases (`git tag vX.Y.Z`) and publish GitHub release notes referencing the changelog entry.
- Submit branding assets to the upstream [`home-assistant/brands`](https://github.com/home-assistant/brands) repository‚Äîthis integration no longer bundles local icons.
